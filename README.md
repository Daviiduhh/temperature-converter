# Temperature Converter

This project is designed to help practice DOM manipulation, form handling, and basic calculations in JavaScript. The temperature converter allows users to enter a temperature value, select the unit they want to convert from, and select the unit they want to convert to.

## Features

- Users can input a temperature value.
- Users can select the unit to convert **from** and the unit to convert **to**.
- The **Convert** button is enabled only when all fields are filled.
- After conversion, the result is displayed below the form.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM manipulation

## How to Use

1. Enter a temperature value in the input field.
2. Select the unit to convert **from** (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
3. Select the unit to convert **to**.
4. The **Convert** button will be enabled once all fields are filled.
5. Click the **Convert** button to display the converted temperature below the form.

## Project Setup

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temperature-converter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd temperature-converter
   ```

   This project focuses on:

- DOM manipulation techniques to handle user input and display results.
- Form validation to ensure the user has provided all required data.
- Performing basic temperature conversion calculations between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Future Improvements

- Adding error handling for invalid inputs.
- Improving the UI/UX with better design and animations.
- Including additional temperature units like Rankine.
- Allowing conversion between more complex unit systems.
